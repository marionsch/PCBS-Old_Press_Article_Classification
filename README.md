# PCBS-Old_Press_Article_Classification
In this project, word2vec is used to classify press articles from a newspaper according to their subjects

The aim of this project is to analyse on old press articles. The database is the newspaper "Le Matin". This newspaper was published in Normandy since the 80s. This newspaper was recently digitized so jason files are available with the titles of articles and their contents. 

At the moment, it is easy to make a research with a date but there is no tool for a research with a subject. In fact, it could be interesting to see evolution of a subject across years or to have all informations about a particular event.

In this project, a part of the database will be used to try to classify articles according to their subjects.
